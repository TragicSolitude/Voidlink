Voidlink is like Reddit but with more <span class="accent">red</span>, more
anonymity, and less features. Apple is a deep inspiration for this creation,
they have really shown that less <em>is</em> more and removing features that
every website has had for ages is just more elegant. So almost every feature
from Reddit has been stripped out to make sure this website is the absolute
best it can be.

&quot;Wait what do you mean <em>more anonymity?</em>&quot;
</p>

<p class="text-block">
More anonymity means exactly that. Go nuts! Voidlink requires an email for
registration and does absolutely nothing with it. It doesn't even have to be
unique! You might ask, &quot;why require an email address at all then?&quot;
That's because every other website you sign up for requires an email address
and there's no need for a website like this to make you feel uncomfortable by
<em>not</em> requiring that.
